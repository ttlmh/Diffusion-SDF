We propose a new generative 3D modeling framework called **Diffusion-SDF** for the challenging task of text-to-shape synthesis. Previous approaches lack flexibility in both 3D data representation and shape generation, thereby failing to generate highly diversified 3D shapes conforming to the given text descriptions. To address this, we propose a SDF autoencoder together with the Voxelized Diffusion model to learn and generate representations for voxelized signed distance fields (SDFs) of 3D shapes. Specifically, we design a novel UinU-Net architecture that implants a local-focused inner network inside the standard U-Net architecture, which enables better reconstruction of patch-independent SDF representations. We extend our approach to further text-to-shape tasks including text-conditioned shape completion and manipulation. Experimental results show that Diffusion-SDF is capable of generating both high-quality and highly diversified 3D shapes that conform well to the given text descriptions. Diffusion-SDF has demonstrated its superiority compared to previous state-of-the-art text-to-shape approaches.
